    <h2>Finn</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 1/2 cups dry dog food</li>
      <li>1 Cosequin pill</li>

    <h2>Murphy</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>1 cup dry dog food</li>
      <li>1/2 Cosequin pill, broken into small pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 Rimadyl pill, broken into two smaller pieces</li>
      <li>1 container wet dog food</li>
      <li>*** ONLY DINNER *** 3/4 Amantedine pill (yes... seriously, it's 3/4 pill)</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Once their food is prepped:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add some water to both bowls to slow them down while they eat.</li>
    <li>Mash up Murphy's wet food into her dry food.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes Murphy doesn't finish her food. Throw in some yogurt, cottage cheese, or pumpkin and she'll usually finish it up. If not, just put her bowl on the counter and give it to her later. Otherwise, Finn will eat it and I don't want him getting any pills she needs.</li>
    <li>If Murphy's bowl is empty, it's totally fine if Finn wants to lick it clean. He will wait until you give him the "ok."</li>
